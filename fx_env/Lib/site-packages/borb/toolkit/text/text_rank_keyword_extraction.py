"""
TextRank – is a graph-based ranking model for text processing which can be used in order to find the most relevant sentences in text and also to find keywords.
The algorithm is explained in detail in the paper at https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf

In order to find relevant keywords, the textrank algorithm constructs a word network.
This network is constructed by looking which words follow one another.
A link is set up between two words if they follow one another, the link gets a higher weight if these 2 words occur more frequenctly next to each other in the text.

On top of the resulting network the Pagerank algorithm is applied to get the importance of each word.
The top 1/3 of all these words are kept and are considered relevant.
After this, a keywords table is constructed by combining the relevant words together if they appear following one another in the text.
